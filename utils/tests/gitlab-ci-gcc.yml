# NS3 CI script for GCC

# Any scheduled pipeline for GCC should define a variable, named
# "RELEASE", that has a value "weekly". Also, a variable "GCC" should be set
# to True.

# We support from 8 to the latest version. Check if everything builds fine
# under debug, release, and optimized, on Linux.
